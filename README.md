Uno-Game-Project
================
Project done during the Fall 2013 for the object-oriented programming course [ LO02 ] at the University of Technology of Troyes.
We designed and developed a Uno card game with UML and Java. The major features we developed were virtual players, game save and load, a graphical user interface.
